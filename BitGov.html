<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>
Innovation is the single most powerful catalyst for change and the only key to survival in a competitive world. As the global landscape around us shifts and morphs into the peaks and pits that mark the political topography of the 21st century how can we expect keep balance while standing in the shadow of old paradigms.

Like the mammoth redwoods of British Columbia the seasoned political institutions of Canada has stood long and true. Roots extending deep into soil of our culture they have endured the turmoil of war and depression. The fortitude and resilience of the Canadian spirit is held aloft in the canopy of this vast timberland.

Soaring off the rockies and gliding over the plains of Alberta, chinooks sweep change across prairies.

Equal and fair representation composes the spin of democratic ideology. If that spine is broken the nation is question will suffer a chronic paralysis and inability to take the innovative steps necessary to adapt to an ever shifting terrain.

The political institutions and systems in place today represent the ideas of a post modern era and are not fit to survive in this new modern era. We have tools available to us today that were not in existence at the time when our constitution was written. As communication technologies have evolved they have dramatically increased the speed efficiency and mode of communication that each individual has with the greater society. The most evolved communication tool being the internet.

It is my belief that the gretest enconberance to the establishment of democracy is repersantation. The opinions and beliefs of every individual are so multifarious that no group of representatives could ever properly reflect the views of the people they govern. Infact I believe that the moment you have even one person representing anyone besides themselves then this representation is not perfect. So then the paradox is that representation is miss-representation.

If it is a difficult task to find even small groups of similar individuals to form consolidated bodies around similar ideologies. Than how impossible and illogical would it to be to suggest that the 308 members of Canadian parliament and the 105 senators come anywhere close to adequately reflecting the beliefs and values of Canadas 34,482,779 citizens. Especially when the 2011 election had a meer 61.1% voter turnout the one before that in 2008 had a record low turnout of 58.8%.

If democracy by definition means a ruling of the people than the primary goal of any nation the claims to uphold democratic values should be to establish a system that brings the maximum degree of political ‘voice’ equally to all its citizens.

As I mentioned above we have a magnificent tool at our disposal that no generation before us has had, the internet. The purpose of this document therefore is to layout in detail the many advantages to the establishment of direct democracy, lay the foundation for how to go about the transition from representative to direct democracy and address innovative solutions to the obstacles involved.

Epic advances are being made in all fields of academic study that pivot the course of history. The range and scope of science is not what it was just one year ago and will not be the same one year from now. While science thunders like Niagara falls our system of politics sits like a stagnant pond, flat as the parties and innovation is a rare as a tree in the tundra.

The systems of government in place today are nearly identical to those of a hundred years ago. Politicians squabble over petty party politics jumping from one caucus to the next more in the hopes of advancing their own careers and securing their reelection than working to serve the good of the people who elected them. Inefficient bureaucracies...

<strong>The Problem of Representation</strong>
<p>
Representation is the greatest flaw in our present form of democracy. The opinions, values, principles and beliefs of any number of denizens are so multifarious that no representative government, no matter how sincere in its intentions, could ever properly reflect the views of its citizens. Therefore the problem is that all representation is miss-representation.

If democracy was designed

No government anywhere in the world can properly represent its citizens interests. The systems of governance that we have now were build in a time when communication was not as easy as it is today. Representation was needed in order for mass cooperation to be possible. Democracy has tried to bring about fair representation, with success in some places and failure in others.

All throughout history communication has been the key to revolution. The printing press, the telephone, the radio, the television and the internet have all dramatically changed the extent and efficiency of communication and access to information. Never before in human history has a mass peer to peer to peer communication system existed. In the past systems of governance and economics have adapted to alterations in the environment. It is, or soon will be, time for our world to again adapt to this new global environment that includes the internet.

The world wide web as we know it today was launched into existence around 1990#. Ten years after its launch there were 360,985,492 users worldwide. As of June 30th 2012 there were 2,405,518,376 users worldwide. Thats about one third of the world's population at the time and a 566.4% growth over 12 years. You can continue to track global internet penetration with online public data from Google, or any alternative source.

These statistics are sublime. Think of what the internet is today and consider that we are only standing on the threshold of the information boom. If you look at the graph on the Google public data page above and plot the data values, you will find and exponential relationship of y=e^0.1691x. If you input the value of 100 for y we can get an idea of what date we could expect to see globe internet penetration. Now obviously this is real world data so other factors need to be taken into consideration, also this data does not include the varying degrees to which all individuals have internet access. A lot rests on how you define access to the internet, does an individual who can once a month get 60 minutes worth of internet access at an internet cafe for an affordable price count? Nonetheless with the data above, if the current trend continues, we could see world wide access to the internet by March 27th 2017.

Now, in more affluent nations such as Canada where 82.68% of the population has access to the internet I believe it would not be impossible to set up a new form of direct democracy through the internet. There would be a need for one verified form of online identification to ensure that someone can not vote more than once, essentially your social insurance number and a password would be needed to cast a vote. I am aware of the cyber security issues involved. Every accounts credentials and votes would need to be fully secured.

A precise set of rules for a voting system would need to be established. I imagine it something like this..

All the laws of a nation could be organized into all its different branches online. If any citizen wanted to change, add to or subtract from legislation they could make the change online, like a wiki. The proposal would then enter a queue and after a time come up onto a virtual legislative floor where it could remain for a week or months, depending on the volume of interest in each . Each proposal on the floor would have a brief and full description of the proposed motions. Next to this information there could be a list of resources that people could use to quickly get informed about the issue from reputable and crowd sourced materials. You could cast your vote at any point while the proposal is on the floor and change it at your will the proposal leaves the floor. After the proposal leaves the floor the necessary changes become effective immediately.
